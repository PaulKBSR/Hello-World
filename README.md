# Hello-World
Noob Tutorial

Hi Folks...

Started programming in Vax VMS in 1986 using C.  Quickly moved to Ultrix/Unix and stayed in that environment for many years.  Wrote mainly database applications and some system level stuff.  Began with Windows using Powerbuilder where I converted a program from Unix to Windows.  Ended my career as an Applications Architect and have been dabbling in Linux since.  I finally decided to a bit more than dabble so here I am. :-)
